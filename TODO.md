# TODO

* DI.fm channel list yml with name and ids
* Generic config with Spotify and DI.fm settings
* Continuously search for new playing tracks and update playlist
* Sleep search loop for at least the length of the currently playing track on DI.dm
* Figure out some clever way when to look for new song and do it more efficiently (ie when the current song finished)
* Initialize a new playlist if --playlist option is passed
